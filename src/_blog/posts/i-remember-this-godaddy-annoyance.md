Forgot about this annoyance with [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com); any time you change anything on your virtual host you have to wait for it to be processed.

I just added a sub-domain and fifteen minutes later it's still in  a 'pending' status.  I wonder how long the new virtual web directory will take to complete?
