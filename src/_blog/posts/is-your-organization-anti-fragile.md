Is your organization anti-fragile?  It isn't enough to be resilient and survive through rough rides.  You need to improve, and become stronger during these times. If you run into something difficult, keep doing it until it is no longer difficult.  Without this continual improvement you will never move ahead.

If your organization isn't Anti-Fragile, you are losing to one that is.
