This is a kids song/rhyme that my son loves to sing. I was thinking about him and the song just now and thought I would share it.

Little Bunny Foo Foo, Hopping through the forest Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head

Down came the good fairy and she said

"Little Bunny Foo Foo, I don't want to see you Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head. I'll give you three chances, And if you don't behave I'll turn you into a goon!"

The next day:

Little Bunny Foo Foo, Hopping through the forest Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head

Down came the good fairy and she said

"Little Bunny Foo Foo, I don't want to see you Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head. I'll give you two more chances, And if you don't behave I'll turn you into a goon!"

The next day:

Little Bunny Foo Foo, Hopping through the forest Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head

Down came the good fairy and she said

"Little Bunny Foo Foo, I don't want to see you Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head. I'll give you one more chance, And if you don't behave I'll turn you into a goon!"

The next day:

Little Bunny Foo Foo, Hopping through the forest Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head

Down came the good fairy and she said

"Little Bunny Foo Foo, I don't want to see you Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head. I gave you three chances And you didn't behave Now you're a goon! POOF!!"

The moral of the story is: HARE TODAY, GOON TOMORROW

\[from: http://www.kididdles.com/lyrics/l007.html \] He has never said the moral, but I thought I would include it anyway. Have a hopp'n day.
