Yes it's true, the porting issue with Comcast may actually be over. For a refresher you can look [here](http://brettski111.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/comcast-is-at-it-again/), or [here](http://brettski111.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/comcast-phone-number-porting-update/). The lady given our case from the executive office of Comcast has been pretty punctual at calling us every couple of days. Unfortunately it's to tell us they are still working on it. It must of been really messed up because it took Comcast over two months to straighten this out. Last week some time we received the call we've been waiting for, that they have fixed the issue and that Comcast has no record anywhere of having control of our phone number. Well I hope it's true--Now that I think of it, I never did ask if my in-laws, Comcast phone users, where able to call me yet.
