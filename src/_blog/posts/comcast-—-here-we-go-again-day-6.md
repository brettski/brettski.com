I received an email from Marta today.  I am glad for the reponse, but not very thrilled by what it said:

Dear Mr. ......,

Thank you for responding and letting us know you are still unable to receive calls from Comcast customers. I have forwarded your communication to our Port Out Escalations Department since they asked for some examples of telephone numbers that are unable to call 847xxxxxxx. I will update you as soon as hear further word.

Thank you for your continued patience.

Marta

Not very comforting to say the least.
