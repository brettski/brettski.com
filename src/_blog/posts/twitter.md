Ok, so I signed up for a twitter account. It all seems really lame, but I thought I would check out a few of these "community" services.

You setup an account, trying to figure out a username nobody has used yet. Of course brettski is taken, I am usually late on that one (go figure). Once you set your username, password, and email account, they ask you for your email address and password for public email services (like Yahoo!) so they can check your address books for names that may have a twitter account. Like I am giving anyone any of my passwords, please. Who would do that, unless it was a total junk account? I just don't want them to have that information. Sure it says, "We don't store your login information." Sure, whatever.

It is what it is, my lame existence on another lame web service, [twitter](http://twitter.com/brettski111).
