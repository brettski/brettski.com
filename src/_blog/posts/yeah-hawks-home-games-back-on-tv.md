I just read an article in the [Daily Southtown](http://www.dailysouthtown.com/sports/cronin/626143,103007_cronin.article) which says the Blackhawks are returning to the air when the are at home! All I have to say to this is, thank you Rocky Wirtz, may you run the Blackawks as a 2010 company not a 1966 company.
