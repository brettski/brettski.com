Hey look, ASP.NET has made it's first live-supported release!  This is great!

I have been using the MVC pattern for a good 8 months now and I just love it.  It just makes so much sence to the way I think. Sure there is a learning curve to get started with ASP.NET MVC, whatever, it's worth the trip.

I read about it [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2009/03/18/asp-net-mvc-1-0-live.aspx) first.  Phil Haack [wrote](http://www.haacked.com/archive/2009/03/18/aspnet-mvc-rtw.aspx) about the release. You can get the release from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=53289097-73ce-43bf-b6a6-35e00103cb4b&displaylang=en).

Remember if you have a previous version of ASP.NET MVC loaded, you will have to unistall it first.  A short time ago, Phil Haack, Scott Hanselman, Rob Conery, and ScottGu release a [FREE tutorial to MVC](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/03/10/free-asp-net-mvc-ebook-tutorial.aspx), as a fist "Chapter" to their upcomming book, [ASP.NET MVC 1.0](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&tag=bretcook-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470384611 'ASP.NET MVC 1.0').
