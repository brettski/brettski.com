Man what a great Summer it has been, as you can tell by the lack of posts here.  So it goes.  Haven't done Jack on [eve-igbtools.com](http://eve-igbtools.com) at all, getting about 20 hits a day still, so at least someone likes the tools.  And, no, there not my hits, as I haven't been gaming either.  Spending the Summer with the kids and it's been great.  Hoping to go to Door County this year, weekend after Labor Day.  I sure do miss that rally.

I just found out today that [Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com) is going to be in Chicago on September 7th.  I can't believe out of all the dates of his "World Tour", he is going to be in Chicago when I am in Door.  Freak'n figures.  I was (still am) really looking forward to seeing his presentation on [FogBugz](http://fogcreek.com/FogBugz/index.html) 6.0.  Really is just my luck.
