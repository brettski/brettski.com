I can't believe it, yet again Comcast has tried to assign our phone number to a new client.  This has been going on for over three years now.  A while back I used Comcast phone service along with their data and cable.  The phone service was no better or cheaper then Ameritech, so bailed (which they didn't care at all when I left, nothing like customer retention).  I switched off of Comcast to go to Vonage and ported my number over to Vonage.  I filled out the needed paperwork and faxed it in, and Vonage took care of re-addressing my phone number to their network, or however that is done in telephony land.  It took almost a month for Comcast to release the number, I spent countless of hours on the phone with both carriers trying to figure out what is going on.  Eventually, it was straightened out and I was well on my way to Vonage bliss.

At work some time later, I called home to say hi to my wife, I couldn't get through!  Forgot what the message was or whatever it was, but I could call home.  So I get back on the phone with Vonage and Comcast to figure out what is going on.  This goes back and forth, off and on for the next couple of months, until finally some smart person at Vonage figured it all out and called the right people at Comcast.   It turns out that Comcast never marked my phone number as ported, or what ever they do there.  I was told all is OK again.  Things where working.

Couple months later my in-laws, who still use Comcast phone, could get through to us, they where getting a quick busy or somthing like that.  It turns out that Comcast has assigned our phone number to a new client of theirs.  It only effects Comcast customers now, within their network, as in reality they have no rights over the number and the rest of the world knows the number is routed to Vonage.  Again they fix it and again it is screwed up, this has been going on and on, and on for years now.

Not sure if this will help at all, but I contacted the FCC and reported Comcast keeps re-assigning our phone number.  We will see where it goes from here.
