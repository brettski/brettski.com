A cute story from my wife.

My wife was driving my son home from school and asked how his day was.

"It was fine.", my son replied.

"Anything new happen at school today?", my wife asked.

"No not really.", "Well we are changing our seats tomorrow.", my son replied

"Oh really, who do you get to sit next to?"

"Just Raeann."

"Just Raeann, eh?", my wife said devilishly.

Now this is the painful part for me, I used hate it when my mother would do this stuff. I would be so embarrassed even if we where the only ones there.  So here she goes...

My wife pseudo sings, "Brett and Raeann sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.  First comes love, then comes marriage..."

My son breaks in here and asks, "What is k-i-s-s....?"

"Kissing.", answers my wife.

She continues, "Brett and Raeann sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.  First comes love, then come marriage, then comes a baby in a baby carriage."

And to that my five year-old son's response was, "You know, I really can't climb a tree."
