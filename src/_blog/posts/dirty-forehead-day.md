The party is over, lent begins, and millions of people are going through the ceremony of Ash Wednesday. I was raised Catholic, and understand the tradition and would never belittle anyone's belief. If it makes you happy--whole, more power to you. My beliefs are my own, and your beliefs are yours.

"Happy Ash Wednesday" Na, that doesn't work.

"Merry Ash Wednesday" Nope.

"Peace be with you" Maybe, that could work

"Shalom" whoops, wrong religion.

I am trying to discover something to say to someone on Ash Wednesday. No real greeting associated with the day. Any Ideas? It's better then what I usually, unintentionally say, "You have a little--something there on your forehead." post updated on 2/23/07
