This is truly an exciting day for me.  The buzz around Microsoft's latest OS reminds me of the release of Windows 95.  Back then it was the new platform, moving away from the DOS/Windows separate systems and memory issues.  It was a fun time.

Now,  many of us have used Windows XP for eight years or so, not liking the newer, problematic OS's which have been released.  I have used Windows 7, and I like it and I know it will be the OS that corporations replace their aging Windows XP machines with.  It's always a good feeling when things are moving forward in a positive direction

Happy Windows 7 Day!!
