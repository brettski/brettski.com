While talking to a friend today via IM, an interesting thing was said,

"The Four Corners of the Round Table."

Basically it was part of many statement this person had to memorize long ago for a talent show. The statement was,

"thank you for your kind attention and now pronounce the next act... The four corners of the round table."

Nonetheless I really like the statement, it fits me pretty well.Â  I will have to use it, as a title or statement no less.
