I would like to get a Wii for my son this Christmas (OK, for me too), but it doesn't look like they are going to be available anywhere. It doesn't seems any stores are selling them, and the places online who are selling them, are charging too much. What gives, what is with this consistent Wii shortage? Some may say that it's planed by Nintendo, but what do they have to gain, people want it, lots of people do, but they can't get it. We are members of the YMCA, they have a Wii in the kids area and all the kids love it. Even they would like to buy a second (or third) machine, but can't because they can't find them. This is really frustrating.
