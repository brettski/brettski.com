It's now 1514 CDT and I have not heard from Comcast today.  This disturbs me since they said they would keep me in the loop of what they are doing.  We will see what happens by the end of the day.

Side note, contact from last issue when the FCC was involved is Kenetta Davis.

Night Update

I received an email this evening from Marta, I have copied it here to share with you:

Dear Mr. ......,

Thank you for contacting the Comcast executive offices regarding your issues and concerns. We are informed your porting and calling issues should be resolved; however, if any Comcast customer are still unable to reach you then we will need specific telephone numbers.

Should you have any questions regarding this communication, please let me know.

Regards,

Marta P. Gardner/ Comcast Executive Customer Care

I actually felt a ray of hope and immediately called my father-in-law to have him try and call here.  Same story he receives a message that the number is not in service.  I wonder if they did anything at all?  I wonder when the FCC is going to pick up the case, I don't remember how long it took them last time, but I don't believe it was over a week or two.

So now I get to respond to her with a phone number and see what poop they can shovel tomorrow.
