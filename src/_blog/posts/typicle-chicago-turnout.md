As a life-long Chicago Blackhawks fan, I am no stranger to disappointment. A great start to the Super Bowl game, kick-off return for a score in 14 seconds, woot. Not a whole lot after that. A few sparks, then nothing. The Colts played a good game, they most certainly deserve this win. As it goes, "Better luck next time".
