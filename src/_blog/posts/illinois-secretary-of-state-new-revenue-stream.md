## **It's Residents!**

I just can't believe it, what they do to earn revenue.  Back in June we received a letter from the Illinois Secretary of State mandating that we send them vehicle insurance information.  No problem, I put the information together, stamped the envelope and forgot it in my bag.  That's right, it never got sent out.

So today we receive another letter from the Illinois Secretary of State stating that our registration is suspended as of September 9th.  To remove this suspention, we must pay $100 and show proof of insurance.  Plain and simple, $100, no if's and's or but's.  I know I can't be the only fool forgetting about sending in the letter.  What about all of the people who never received it, because we know how accurate the USPS is all the time?

So the Illinois Secretary of State is now collection $100 "fees" from their hard working residents who pay there taxes and keep full coverage insurance on all their vehicals because it's their only way to work.  I can see it now, my $100 going into the general fund, through some law or two then right into to pocket of Governor Rod Blagojevich, or perhaps the Secretary himself, Jesse White.
