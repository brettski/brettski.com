Yes, once again the shit colectith and stinkith, and I must get it the heck out. While sweeping up the kitchen floor and pondering the pile seeping over from the adjoining playroom. Enough! I just can't take this anymore.  I head off to the garage to grab a large paper garbage bag.  You know, one of those used to put leaves in during the Fall.

Over the next hour I start digging through the piles of toys and junk.  There are two racks of bins to put stuff in which haven't been moved in years.  There is much stuff behind them as there is in them.  I move them away from the wall and start tossing stuff out.

Bag two!

Bag three!  Now I am on  a roll!

I have worked my way down and have hit a toy box.  Damn these kids have a lot of shit.  Just too much stuff.  I bet they don't even know half of what is here.  Shit half of this stuff is bits an pieced to games and other toys. There is no way these games can be played again, the needed pieces are all over the place.  Knowing which pieces go to which non-played-games, they start going in the trash.  This stuff causes more stress than it's worth.  If I screw up and throw out the absolutely-most-important-game-ever, well we can deal with it then.  Like they say, it is much easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission.

Bag four! Progress has been made, two hours have gone by and I am wearing down.  This is an excellent start and there is an absolute noticeable difference.  Tomorrow is another day, and more shit will go.  And oh yes, this is just the beginning.  My goal for this year is to get the garage organized so I can work out there and get things done.  There has has been a pile of "Garage Sale" stuff in my workbench area for two years.  I have had it and it has to go.  If my wonderful wife doesn't do something with the pile she just has to sell, it is all going to Purple Hearts, or other charitable organization.

You may have no idea how nice it feels to reduce and purge the crap out of your life, until you just dig in and toss out.  The stuff is just not needed, stop hording.

By Getting a solid start in March, this will be a great Purging Year, just like some of [my](http://blog.brettski.com/2008/01/07/2008-the-great-purge/ "2008 The Great Purge") [previous](http://blog.brettski.com/2008/01/21/purge-purge-purge/ "Purge, Purge, Purge") [ones](http://blog.brettski.com/2010/04/12/purge-2010/ "Purge 2010").  My reward the return of a garage I can work in, and organize (Need to find a refrigerator though).  I have owned a vice for 6 years and haven't mounted on the work bench.  Instead I use make-shift clamps, stupid.

By the way, I have an old 1U and 2U server going to the recycler, I you need them let me know before they are gone.
