I remember spending much of my pre-teen and teen years flipping and drooling in the once defacto electronics guide, The Radio Shack Catalog.  No always the best products, but it sure had everything.

I have been introduced to a website archiving all of these great catalogs, and it's been fun looking at all those products again.  I am amazed at how many I still have; which still work!

The TRS-80, one of the first computers I fiddled with.  STA-7 stereo receiver, which is still in use today.  Liner tracking turntable.  Chronomatic 248 clock radio (introduced in the 1986 catalog).

What items do you still have and use?  What items do you remember the most?
