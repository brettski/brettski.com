There is a new M&M commercial out for their M&M ice cream which really made me smile.  Enough, so I had to write about it.

Red M&M and Yellow Peanut M&M are really cold in a freezer wondering if life will go on, when the door is opened and they are asked to leave the stores freezer unit.  As they are leaving the Yellow Peanut M&M asks, "Why is my 'M' so small."

As replied by Red M&M, "It's called shrinkage."

Nice.  :P

Here is a video of it someone recorded off of their TV: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3QKtMFeFcY
