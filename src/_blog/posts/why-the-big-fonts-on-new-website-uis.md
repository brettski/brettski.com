As I log into [My](http://my.yahoo.com) Yahoo! account I am greeted with a message that a new updated version of My Yahoo! site is available as a beta site. Since Yahoo! usually lets you go back to the old version again, I thought I would check it out. Basically it has become the typical AJAX'd to hell big font "Web2.0" site. Fooy. I don't get the new interfaces with all this Javascript, big-ass fonts, and bubbly edges, they are just such bloated pigs. The new font resolutions make it really difficult to use anything but a full-screened browser, which I hate to do. The UI is windowed for a reason. The My Yahoo! beta reminds me a lot of the new mail interface Yahoo! designed a few years ago. No I don't use it either, it was just to slow and clunky of an interface back then, though I haven't tried it again.  Another part that irked me is that many of the modules I had on My Yahoo! page no longer worked on the new site.  Why would you offer a new layout if many of the items which are used, aren't available any longer?  I don't get that.

[FogCreek](http://www.fogcreek.com) Software's FogBugz has done the same thing with their latest release, 6.0. Changed to this really fat font and some other layout changes. I understand UI changes always take some time to get used to, but even after three weeks using the product, it still doesn't feel natural. Funny, reading Joel Spolsky's [blog](http://joelonsoftware.com), when he returned to New York after his first demo tour for FogBugz 6.0 he himself the UI has been [stripped](http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/09/11.html) down way to much and it's just horrible. It happens, anyone in development knows it. At least he is being smart about it and re-doing it from step one.

I have to say that I am happy that so far Yahoo! hasn't forced me into using their new interfaces for their products. I don't think that I am that stubborn when it comes to changes, I just expect at least to have the same functionality that I did in a previous version. Don't make me take two steps backwards in functionality when you introduce a new product.

I would really like to know why web designers are thinking this new larger font is the way to go on web pages? I am seeing it more and more, and I still find it less appealing and usable.
