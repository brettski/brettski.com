After searching and searching for a new web host who can provide me with Windows 2008 server and decent number of MS SQL databases without breaking the bank (>$20 / mo.), I finally found one to sign up with and try out.  That company is [Planet Small Business](https://www.planetsmb.com) hosting, wish me luck!

**5/1/2009@1600:** First thing to run into, is that it seems account setup is a manual (human-driven) process.  I couldn't pay and keep going with the setup.  Just for the record, I finished my payment by 1600 on Friday, May 1, 2009.

**5/1/2009@1620:** OK, Site was available in about 20 minutes, that is acceptable.  Well as long as it's automated and I can set up stuff at 2am.

**5/1/2009@1645:** 45 minutes into this setup, and no email from them about the site.  I do have access to it though.  What are their DNS addresses, I can't find them anywhere.

**5/1/2009@1808:** I sent a ticket into tech support asking about DNS server address and email, and they replied in 10 minutes.  I sent this at 1805 and received it at 0614, that's good response(!).  Once DNS propagates, I should be good to go.  With n0t getting the email, I wonder if Yahoo! has blacklisted them; it happens. Well not in this case, the emails where in my junk folder, not sure how I missed them the first time. Oh well, one of these days I will learn how to use an email client.

**5/1/2009@2030** The host uses a new version of Plesk.  Pretty easy finding things, speed is tolerable.  Now it's just taking the time to configure the server and how they run things.  So far it's looking OK.

**5/1/09@2130** Hey cool!  I have been a little bummed over the fact that PlanetSMB only allows one domain (unlimited aliases).  I was wondering how I was going to host all of my domains.  I wasn't really interested in purchasing separate packages, as it would be a pain flipping between them.  Well I discovered it just now, their reseller plans support multiple domains, and at a fair price, and still with UNLIMITED MS SQL databases.  Pretty sweet if you ask me.

But before I get too excited here, I need to get my applications loaded up on the site and see how the run.

**5/4/09@2259** I have loaded up two of my ASP.NET MVC applications and they are both running perfectly.  One of the two uses SQL2008, and that is working great to.  I must say I like Plesk 9.2 a whole lot better than HELM 3.16, which is getting quite dated.  All the stuff available to me for $5 a month is just great.  If you are a .NET developer and need a place to throw your stuff, this is it.  The systems are ready to rock 'n roll.

OK here is a big wtf they are pulling.  The mid level developer package I am using only allow 1 mailbox.  Yeah you read that correctly, one mailbox.  You can alias other email addresses to it, but still only one box.  Very, strange.  Even their reseller packages are pretty restricted on mailboxes.

There is no doubt, if service levels remain the same, I will move all my domains over to [planetsmb.com](http://plantsmb.com) using a reseller package for multiple domain support.

**5/26/2009:** It's been a few weeks I have been using PlanetSMB and everything is fine.  I setup a DotNetNuke portal pretty painlessly and haven't had any issues with my .NET 3.5 sites.  I like the fact that I can setup a new database for whatever and not have to worry about running out of allotted databases.  Makes life much easier when your host doesn't get in your way.

Come this August I will be moving all my domains from iHostasp.net to PlanetSMB, as my iHostasp.net account lapses in September.  I am planning for a happy future with my new host.
