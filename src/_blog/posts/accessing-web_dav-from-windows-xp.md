This has driven me crazy for weeks, I just haven't been able to access web_dav I setup at [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?490900).

I found a perfect article on how to do it at [Geek Boy's Blog](http://blog.pclark.net/2005/03/fun-with-windows-xp-and-webdav.html).  It's so simple,...

Make sure you add the port number to the url you provide for the network place.

E.g. http://www.mydomain.com:80/foo

Once I did that, I connected instantly.  No more need for third party apps, I can just access it. :)
