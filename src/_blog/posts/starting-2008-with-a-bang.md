Great start to the year, the Family spent New-Years eve at a water park, still cannot forget it snowing outside, while we swam inside watching it snow.   Since January 6th or so, it started, one-by-one, we all caught a virus.  A really nasty one at that, it's just starting to clear up and now we are dealing with it's aftermath of destruction on our sinuses.  My wife and the little one, both have sinus infections now, and I know my head is pumping out a good gallon of gook a day.  What a great start to the year...
