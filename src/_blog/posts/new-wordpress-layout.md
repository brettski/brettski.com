So I logged in the other day and noticed that Wordpress changed things around a bit. Nothing horrible but surely different. Anyway I don't get the changes as they don't seem to solve any issue, they are just a different way to do the same thing. And now I am just trying to figure out how to do /x/ now.Â  Perhaps I am just missing it all together...
