After four or so years of using wordpress.com for my blog I finally figured out how to highlight code (prettify) in a blog post.

A thank you to [@jasonclevine](http://twitter.com/#!/jasonclevine) who sent me message on twitter on how to do this.

All you need to do is wrap your code with

\[sourcecode language="wordpress"\]

\[sourcecode language="xxxx"\] \[/sourcecode\]

\[/sourcecode\]

There are a bunch of different languages supported and other options which can be defined.Â  You can find all the details here: [http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/](http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/)
