If you have kids, I am sure you are aware on how much they love foamy soap. You know that pump soap which comes out as a foam. They just love to pump the soap....

Well that stuff is expensive and doesn't seem to last long at all. I discovered a great way to refill to foamy soap dispensers for pennies. Just take a regular refill pump soap and add equal amounts of water to it. That is all there is to it. It will work just fine in your foamy pump dispenser. You may want to play with the soap to water ratio depending on the bulk soap your using.

Happy Washing!
