I have wondered for some time how to keep footers at the bottom of the page.  I have tried different methods of minimum heights, etc., but it only ever looked just "OK".

On [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) today, the a question was asked about sticky footers and a method being used to achieve them.  I thought the solutions interesting so I wanted to post them so I might be able to find this later.
