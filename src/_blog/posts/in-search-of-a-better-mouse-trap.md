I have this really, really bad habit; I spend a lot of time searching and trying out new tools for my tool box.  Some times to such extent I never get around to actually using the tools to build something, and that is just silly.

On the positive side is have given me a lot of exposure to the many, many options available to us, but on the negative side I think I use it as a form of procrastination.  If I am looking for for something, than I don't actually have to 'work' on something.  How convenient.

The toughest part, is that I really enjoy checking out different applications.  Experiencing what so many are putting their hard work into.

So I have started a [list](http://home.brettski.com), it is by no means complete, nor do I really plan on making it complete.  Though it will give you a pretty good idea on all the different things I have checked out and played around with.
