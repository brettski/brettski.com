I find it strange how numbers correlate in your life. Recently I discovered a pattern that caught my fancy.

In 1999 I was laid off from a company on Friday the thirteenth, the number has been lucky to me ever since. Really the best thing that could of happened to me at the time.

Just recently I submitted my resignation to my employer on March 13th, not a Friday, but hey.

The head hunter who help me find my current job, was located on the eleventh floor of their building. My current job is located on the eleventh floor. My new job, again, is on the eleventh floor.

I find it very interesting indeed.
