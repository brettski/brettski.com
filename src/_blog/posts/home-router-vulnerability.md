This is pretty nasty and will surly have a wide impact on home Internet users.  I just read about an exploit which has the potential of affecting millions of home internet users.  The exploit affects home routers and will be explained in detail next month at the Black Hat conference in Vegas.

I shouldn't have to say this, but **IF YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED THE DEFAULT PASSWORD ON YOUR HOME ROUTER, DO IT NOW!!!**

Don't think it really matters?  Well [here](http://www.routerpasswords.com/) is how easy it is to get a list of default passwords.

If you don't know what to do, call someone who does know what to do.  If you don't know who to call, call me (i.e. leave me a comment) I will be more than happy to help anyone secure their home network.
