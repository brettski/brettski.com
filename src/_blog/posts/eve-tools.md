For those of you who enjoy [EVE Online](http://www.eve-online.com), I have built some tools for you. Sure there are others out there like these, but there are mine. They contain:

- Skill Calculator, with end date
- End Date Calculator, based of days, hours, minutes, and seconds left in training
- Mining Calculator, for a selected miner, shows you your rate of mining based on your skills. Displays time required to mine all types of ore.
- Miner Yield, put in the installed yield of your miner(s) and find out how long you can fill a can and how many batches of ore you will have to refine.
