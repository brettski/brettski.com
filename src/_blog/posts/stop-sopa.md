I feel bad I am late to the game on this, but the most important part is that I am in the game.

For more information about SOPA and PIPA please use google or these links:

I really like the writeup in the Dreamhost blog.  If these bills go through it will be the end of the Internet as we have known it. And not for the better.

And of course this blog too will be shutdown on the 18th.  Sorry to my one follower, but it all for the better.
