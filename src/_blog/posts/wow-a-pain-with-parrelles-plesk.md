I have been using [Planet SMB](http://www.planetsmb.com) hosting for a year or more now, and find them to be an adequate host who give a lot of stuff for the dollar.  I wouldn't run a high availability application on them, but than again, I am not doing that, so it all works out.  I highly recommend them for any developer who needs a place to showcase stuff and use as a staging site or fee-based hosting site for their clients.  To clarify, when I say high availability, I don't complain about them having downtime, because I really don't experience much at all.  The issue I do have is wait times.  For applications to spin up, and the Plesk Panel which seems to always be painfully slow and times out. No phone support, though emails are usually answered in a decent amount of time.

The issue I had with Plesk is that when I setup my domains (I get 5!) an expiration date was set on them.  So today at some time they just stopped working!  WTF!  I know I never set this date, is this some strange default which was set?

I set in a critical ticket to [PlanetSMB](http://www.planetsmb.com) and it's been 15 minutes and no reply.  In this case I figured out what happened, but I still want to see how long it takes to reply to my _critical_ ticket.

**UPDATE:** So this is cool, I heard from PlanetSMB Support (Mike Eldredge actually, the owner) in 16 minutes with a good answer to my issue.  So he was right on it with the critical ticket, Yeah Mike!
