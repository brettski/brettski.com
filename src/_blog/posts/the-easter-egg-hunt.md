Every year thousands of kids gather here and there to partake in a hunt for multi-colored plastic eggs filled with an array of goodies. This year my family and I went to a local church for a twenty-five thousand egg hunt. Man how would you like to fill all of them eggs, or more interesting, hide them? Well, there isn't much "hunting" for eggs at these events, unless you consider shooting fish in a barrel, hunting. With so many eggs and so many kids, it's more of an _Egg Dash_ then a hunt. None the less, it is great fun for all, even in the thirty-five degree weather. Good thing hot chocolate and popcorn was available
