This has been a really exciting season, it is fun to watch the Hawks again.  There is so much life in the team and the fans.  I can't wait to get back into the stadium to see them play!

I have to thank Rocky Wertz for this.  Thank you for bringing all games back to TV.  Thank you for bring Pat Foley back as our voice.  Thank you for giving us the tools we need to get back on top.  Its up to the team, a team which is finally gelling after more then a decade of dieing.

See you in the play-offs.
