I want to know, [how often do you verify file hashes](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/S98MKHS)?

Most of us are continuously downloading files from the internet.  With many of these files there is a posted hash value to verify the integrity of the file.  How often do you actually make sure that the file's hash value is equal to what is posted?

If you are using windows there is a really convenient, easy to use program called BD File Hash.  This super small, .NET based application will calculate and verify file hashes using MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 algorithms.  If there is a different type of hash you require, leave me a comment and I will see if can be added to the application.
