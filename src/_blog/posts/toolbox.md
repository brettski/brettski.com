Being an IT Slug, I find myself using a lot of different tools.  Many tools are 'first installs' when starting to use a new box.  Since I have been thinking about changing jobs, which means a full forklift of my toolbox to a new machine, I decided to start writing down what I have installed, sitting in the tools folder, etc.  I was about to put the list in my regular notes system, [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com), but decided to put them in the  blog instead. There are boat-loads of tool lists out there, so why shouldn't I have my own?  :)

The list is in no particular order, just as I found them in my head or on my system.  Perhaps I will organize them some day...
