The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2012 annual report for this blog.

[![](http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/emailteaser.jpg)](http://blog.brettski.com/2012/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


<blockquote>600 people reached the top of Mt. Everest in 2012. This blog got about **8,000** views in 2012. If every person who reached the top of Mt. Everest viewed this blog, it would have taken 13 years to get that many views.</blockquote>
