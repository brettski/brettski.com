I would like to coin April first, officially, the Onion Day.  Since [the Onion](http://www.theonion.com) is dedicated to our news enjoyment and most people could never write to their unique standard, we should let the best be the best and celebrate their crafty pen.  There isn't a better news source and there isn't a better day to dedicate to them.  All rejoice and cheer for the Onion and their new special day.
