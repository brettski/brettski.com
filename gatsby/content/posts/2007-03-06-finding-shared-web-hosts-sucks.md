Man I cannot believe how difficult it has been trying to find a new web host.  This is a nightmare (almost).  I have a feeling it's my price-point that is hurting me.  It's very true, you get what you pay for.  [Crystal Tech](http://crystaltech.com)  seems to be a great option, I am just not ready to shell out $16 a month for a host.  I was surprised to see [Steve](http://www.furrygoat.com) is unhappy with [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com), as they have a great amount of services, and they would of been the hosting site for me on the UNIX side, but it turns out they view SLA's and downtime flippantly, which sucks for a host, $10 a month shared or not.  Perhaps I should grab one of my really old pc's, set it up in the basement and host from there?  Anyway the search goes on.
