Wow, I was pretty excited when I read this morning that [SourceGear ](http://www.sourcegear.com)has created a stand-alone version of it's excellent diff tool, [DiffMerge](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html)!  [Eric Sink](http://www.ericssink.com) wrote about it on his [blog](http://www.ericsink.com/entries/DiffMerge.html) June fourth.  I have been using SourceGear's [products](http://www.sourcegear.com/products.html) for a few [years](http://brettski111.wordpress.com/2007/02/16/scms/) now and am very satisfied with them.  I was even able to get their Vault application to work at my [web host](http://www.ihostasp.net).  DiffMerge has always been bundled with Vault and I was impressed with it the first time I used it.  I even created a shortcut to it in my vault folder.  I was never sure why SourceGear didn't do that?

Give a try, I know you will be very happy with the product.  Plus it works on multiple platforms, [Windows](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html), [Linux](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html), and [Mac](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html)!
