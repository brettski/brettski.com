I can't wait, this is going to be great.  This Thursday, Friday and Saturday I will be taking care of my kids, solo, while my wife is out of town.  Being the IT Slug that I am and commuting 3+ hours a day I don't get a lot of time with my kids during the week.  Now I have my chance.  I am taking the next two days off from work and spending it at home.  ahhhh.

It would be great if we could go somewhere, like Downtown Chicago or something, but my eldest has school and other after-school activities, so that is out.  Weather report looks positive, I get out of work for a few days and my kids get to see how nuts their father is.Â  Oh, in case you are wondering my sons are 5 years and 19 months. What a great age.
