Every insurance company advertising on Internet, radio, and TV says they can save me up to $400 on my insurance, or 20%, or whatever.

This is the way I figure it:  If I keep changing between the different insurance companies and keep saving and saving with each one, eventually they will start paying me to use their insurance.  Yeah, that'll do it
