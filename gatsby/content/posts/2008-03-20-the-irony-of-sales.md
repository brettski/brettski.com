For many years the president of my current employer has told us to always look for prospective client.  "You meet people all day long, talk to them, find out who they work for", he would say.

So I would do that time to time, talk to people about their jobs and where they work, size of the company, etc.  Oddly enough, one of the people I was talking to will now be my future boss!

It's always good to talk with people.
