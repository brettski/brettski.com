I Really hate chain eMails, I really do...

You know what I am going to say next, "but this one..."

Well your correct, not sure where the guy got 85B from, but it sure would pump some money back into the system.  The only problem with it is that most Americans, unfortunately, are not responsible enough to pay off their debts.  They would think they were rich and fall further into debt.  You see this happen all the time with lottery winners.  How great will it be if it really did happen?!?

I would love to pay of my house and purchase a _new_ motorcycle.  You know, I wouldn't pressure my employer for such a large raise anymore either.  Without my mortgage, my family will be able to build our wealth again without raising costs on my employer.  Hmmm

_By the way, if you know who originally wrote this, please let me know so I may give credit where it's due!_

OK, I really do hate chain eMails, I really do, and still do.  I should of never posted this without checking at least the numbers.  Pfft, I am ashamed.

So 85,000,000,000 / 200,000,000 = 425; not 425,000.  So $425 per person is more like the current administrations attempt to spark the economy, which basically I used to buy groceries.

This idea sounds just crazy enough to possibly work, so naturally it won't
be given serious consideration.  How great is our government??

Hi Pals,

I'm against the $85,000,000,000.00 bailout of AIG.

Instead, I'm in favor of giving $85,000,000,000 to America in a We Deserve
It Dividend.

To make the math simple, let's assume there are 200,000,000 bona-fide U.S.
Citizens 18+.

Our population is about 301,000,000 +/- counting every man, woman and child.
So 200,000,000 might be a fair stab at adults 18 and up..

So divide 200 million adults 18+ into $85 billion that equals $425,000.00.

My plan is to give $425,000 to every person 18+ as a We Deserve It Dividend.

Of course, it would NOT be tax free.

So let's assume a tax rate of 30%.

Every individual 18+ has to pay $127,500.00 in taxes.

That sends $25,500,000,000 right back to Uncle Sam.

But it means that every adult 18+ has $297,500.00 in their pocket.

A husband and wife has $595,000.00.

What would you do with $297,500.00 to $595,000.00 in your family?

Pay off your mortgage - housing crisis solved.

Repay college loans - what a great boost to new grads

Put away money for college - it'll be there

Save in a bank - create money to loan to entrepreneurs.

Buy a new car - create jobs

Invest in the market - capital drives growth

Pay for your parent's medical insurance - health care improves

Enable Dead-beat Dads to come clean - or else

Remember this is for every adult U S Citizen 18+ including the folks who
lost their jobs at Lehman Brothers and every other company that is cutting
back. And of course, for those serving in our Armed Forces.

If we're going to re-distribute wealth let's really do it...instead of
trickling out a puny $1,000.00 ( 'vote buy' ) economic incentive that is
being proposed
by one of our candidates for President.

If we're going to do an $85 billion bailout, let's bail out every adult U S
Citizen 18+!

As for AIG - liquidate it.

Sell off its parts.

Let American General go back to being American General.

Sell off the real estate.

Let the private sector bargain hunters cut it up and clean it up.

Here's my rationale. We deserve it and AIG doesn't.

Sure it's a crazy idea that can 'never work.'

But can you imagine the Coast-To-Coast Block Party!

How do you spell "Economic Boom"?

I trust my fellow adult Americans to know how to use the $85 Billion.

We Deserve It Dividend more than I do the geniuses at AIG or in Washington
DC.

And remember, The Birk plan only really costs $59.5 Billion because $25.5
Billion is returned instantly in taxes to Uncle Sam.

Can you imagine what might happen if the bailout, $700 billion was given as
a We Deserve It Dividend?
