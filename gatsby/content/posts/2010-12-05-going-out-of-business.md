I'm sure its not unique to the Chicago-land area but since shortly after the dot com demise in '99 furniture stores have had many "going out of business" sales. In the beginning  it seemed sad that all these stores where going out of business; some of them even more than once (wtf).  Now it is just a joke and obviously a scam to get sales.

See most people automatically feel they are betting a "deal" when a place is closing down, clearing stuff out, etc.  Though in all honesty it's shit, udder, stinky crap.  Walk into 99% of these "going out of business" stores and you will find very high prices and stock of all the stuff that doesn't really sell well (crap).  This is because all of the good stuff was put into a truck and sent to some other store to be sold.  That other store too will be closed down in short time.  I really think this is the furniture stores new business plan, open for a year and "clear out" stock and move to a new lease.

In Orland Park Illinois there was a store I respected for some time.  Many members of my family, including myself purchased furniture there.  About 4 years ago they had a going out of business sales, I was honestly sad they where going away.  Well as you probably guessed, they are still there, it was nothing more than a scam to increase sales.  Bullshit if they sold enough to keep the doors open.

Look around any Saturday, how many human signs do you see standing around promoting "going out of business" furniture stores?
