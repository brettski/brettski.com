I have never been a big fan of [Coinstar](http://coinstar.com); I have always felt they were a ripoff.  To get paper for your change your are going to pay 8 9/10 (what is this gasoline?) cents per dollar for those machine to count it.  Fuck that!  No way I am paying anyone to give me my money.

My view has changed; they now have gift cards/eCerts which they don't charge you any fees to cash your change into.  This I can deal with, especially because it's companies I would exchange my coin in for ([amazon.com](http://amazon.com), [JC Penny's](www.jcpenny.com), etc.)

I am a big change saver, always have been.  My goal growing up is that I would save my change to purchase ski equipment with.  I bought the boots, but never got around to the actual ski's and now I really don't ski enough to purchase my own stuff.  I have all these jugs of change around and I am not sure what to spend it on--until now.

As anyone who knows me knows, I am an avid motorcyclist.  Sure I don't put in the miles I used to, but having a family will do that to you.  I don't mind, I love my family, and if my cards are right, I will be touring on two wheels again.  I need a new helmet, and have been looking at [Shoei](http://shoei.com) [Mulitec's](http://www.shoei-helmets.com/road/helmets_road.aspx?h=13).  A neat full-face helmet which has a lift-up chin guard, pretty cool.  As like most [Shoei](http://shoei.com) gear, they aren't cheap, 500 bucks.  Now that I can change my coin into an Amazon.com eCert and they will allow me to purchase items in Amazon's [Marketplace](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161232), I will cash in my coin for a new helmet.

Basically all I can say is, "Good job [Coinstar](http://coinstar.com); you have taken a person who couldn't stand your service and turned them into a customer."
No if you can just hook up with some companies so I can buy gas, or rent cars or buy plane tickets.
