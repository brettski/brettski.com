So I read today:



	
  * 


<blockquote>Amazon Fire TV now supports 4K Ultra HD for true-to-life picture quality. Watch high-definition 1080p streams on Amazon Video, Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and more, even without a 4K TV.</blockquote>





Today is 7/1/2016. By 2018 it will be 16k or maybe 32k true-life picture.
