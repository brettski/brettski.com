I am diving head-first into the world of .NET 3.5.  And not having the support of my employer, I am flying solo, using the Express versions of Visual studio.

I ordered this, and hoping it will be a promising reference for me.

[Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform, Fourth Edition (Windows.Net).](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598849?ie=UTF8&tag=bretcook-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1590598849)

**Update (10/23/2008):**
Well ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bretcook-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1590598849)truth be told the book is excellent, a very good reference to add to my collection.  It doesn't have a lot of ASP.NET information in it and I really need help in this area.  See, simply, I am UI challenged.  When it comes to writing web front ends, forget it.  Sure I have done a good bit of web work, but most of it was hacking on stuff already put together.

No I wonder my next step.  [Apress](http://www.apress.com) has two C# ASP.NET books and I am not sure which one to get.  There is a Pro book and a Beginners book.

[Beginning ASP.NET 3.5 in C# 2008: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition (Beginning from Novice to Professional)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598911?ie=UTF8&tag=bretcook-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590598911)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bretcook-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1590598911)

[Pro ASP.NET 3.5 in C# 2008, Second Edition (Windows.Net)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598938?ie=UTF8&tag=bretcook-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590598938)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bretcook-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1590598938)

They both have good ratings but I wonder if the Pro version will just be more information that I care about and may skip over some basic things I don't understand about web UI design.  On the other hand the basic book may be too basic and not add any "meat" to its explainations.  I don't learn as well if I don't understand why something is doing what it is.  I guess it's time for a trip to the bookstore and flip throuh some pages.  I wonder if my family will ever let me out to do that...
