There is a simple beauty about the the Internet that just keeps me wanting more an more.

Anytime; anytime at all I need to see something, find something, it's just there, waiting for me.  Want to hear a song, just search for it and there it is.  Just wonderful.  Remember those 80's videos you watched over and over again, just look in utube, they are there, just wonderful.  Once we get to a superb quality, WooHoo.

It's just wonderful
