GM is been in the shit for decades, they are just pulling new excusses now

They couldn't sell cars in the 90's so they came up with leasing for the masses

Then they had all these used cars sitting around from turning over leases, so that caused the introduction of "Certified" used cars to keep those moving too.  This made "Like" new cars to middle America.

Now people are truly broke and hold on to their cars until the government says it's unfit for the road.  They have no choice.  They have no money left and nobody is extending them credit.
