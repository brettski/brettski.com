I will not remove the Hello, World default post from WordPress, I just won't.

Why should I, it is the start of the blog, the first post.   I may even keep the About page, just because.  Hey, every time I learned a new programming language, the first thing I create is a Hello, world page, script, whatever; so why not have one here?   Not exactly sure where it started, but I bet there's an entry on Wikipedia for it...

Well yes it is at Wikipedia, right [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello%2C_world).  The article states that Hello, world started with the book from Kernigham and Ritche, one of my favorites, "The [C](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/) programming Language."

I wonder if it became popular from that book?   I just re-read this book in November, because I was looking to get back to my roots.  It was fun, but now I'm over it.  There are such better ways to work with strings these days.  I really do like how it makes me think.  A little pointer arithmetic once in a while is good for the soul.   So, anyway, the Hello, world post stays.

Care to debate on it's capitalization?  :)
