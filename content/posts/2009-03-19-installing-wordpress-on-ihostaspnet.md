OK John I couldn’t wait, so I tried it out now, this is what I did.  It installed for me, no problem, only took a couple of minutes.

Here are the basic steps I took:



	
  1. Created a new sub-domain, wp (wp.brettski.com)

	
  2. Downloaded wordpress and unzipped the files (version 2.7.1 right from home page)

	
  3. Uploaded my wordpress file to the server

	
  4. Created a version 4 MySql database

	
    1. Create a user for the database




	
  5. Followed the “Famous 5-minute install” instructions located on [this page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

	
    1. Edited the wp-config.php file as instructed in 5-minute install and the file itself.




	
  6. Once I did that ran, Http://wp.brettski.com/wp-admin/install.php

	
    1. -That opened to a page, I entered the blog name and my email address, and clicked install.




	
  7. A few moments later I was greeted with a success page and my admin username and password.
