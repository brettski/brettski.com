Well another two and one-half hours in the bowels of Symantec and nothing.  I think I may have to call them myself and try to get to the security group.  Tech support is NOT the right channel.  Resolution on this issue is two forked: A, find out the reason the definitions find SuperScan 2.06 a back door, and B, learn how to properly exclude areas of a computer from the wrath of Symantec Anti-Virus.
