Oh, but it feels sooooo good.  It's only the second week of June and we had to turn out A/C on already; mostly so everyone will get a good night's sleep.  It's really, really humid here in Chicago, so much so everything is sticking together.  I don't mind it so much, but anyone with kids knows, let them get a good nights sleep, or everyone will be miserable.  I am actually beginning to miss having the windows in the house.  It seems it's too cold from winter, and spring.  Then before you know it, it's 85 and 73% humidity.

Oh well.
