My wife showed me this [article](http://www.dailyherald.com/commitments/display.asp?id=3912124) (JENNIFER MORRISON, JESSE SPENCER) in the paper this morning, and I will have to say, Jennifer Morrison's parents are pretty cool (though Jennifer may not agree). For you that don't know, Jennifer Morrison is on of the star doctors on the TV show House.  One of the few television programs I watch, and alway watch with my wife.  Jennifer Morison's parents live in the town next to mine, also where Jennifer grew up.  You never know, the next television star may be living right next door to you, even in the mid-West.
