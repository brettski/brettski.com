You mentioned that you can improve with documentation.

Try this. Every time you use documentation, add or adjust a part of it that wasn't right. If there is no documentation for something you are looking for, start some. You don't need to document the entire thing, just a start with perhaps a summary or note on what you want to remember next time. With an iterative approach to documentation it will get done and stay more up-to-date.
