It seems to me, when you do Internet searches you need an option to specify the maximum number of words which separate your search items.

I don't know how many times I search for an item (e.g. my name) and receive links to blogs or other long pages of information where the two words I searched for are separated by 1000 words, and have no corralation between them.  You can't use quotes, that is for exact matches.  This really leads to many, many false matches and waisted time searching for stuff.  Specially stuff which is difficult to find.
