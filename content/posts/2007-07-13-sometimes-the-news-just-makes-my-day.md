# Nobel winner sorry for Bush comment


Published July 13, 2007

DALLAS, TEXAS -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Betty Williams apologized Thursday for saying she could kill President Bush, remarks that shook up the International Women's Peace Conference in Dallas.

Yes, you read right, "Nobel Peace Prize winner... apologized ... for saying she could kill President Bush..."
I guess the peace really isn't in her?
