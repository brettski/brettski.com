As a life-long Chicago Blackhawks fan, I am no stranger to disappointment.  A great start to the Super Bowl game, kick-off return for a score in 14 seconds, woot.  Not a whole lot after that.  A few sparks, then nothing.  The Colts played a good game, they most certainly deserve this win.  As it goes, "Better luck next time".
