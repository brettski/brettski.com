I had a bit of a realization today and I am not exactly sure what my next step should be.

I make a pretty decent living for what I do.  I work hard and provide value to my employer.  It is no secret that I have been looking to expand my professional experience within this or another company, though finding a new career has proven to be much more difficult than I could imagine.

After a recent interview, which I thought went really well (and was told, 'thank you but not a good fit') I had a conclusion.  I am really good at what I do and have been paid accordingly for it. Though to go somewhere else and ask for the same salary the employers are looking with someone with more experience driving businesses.  I have worked more hands-on and have not been looked to for big-picture ideas and scope.   I can have all the ideas and passion in the world, but without the experience, it seems no one is going to take a chance on me.  And why should they, there are another 105 people applying for the same position.

So now my next question for myself is, what is your next step to move toward a better career path (a personal target condition)?
