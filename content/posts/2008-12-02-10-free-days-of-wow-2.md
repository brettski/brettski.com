Yeah, so I have ten free days.  I think I have been logged in for a total of one hour.  It's been so long since I have logged in, It's going to take me a week to get up to speed.  There is hours of research to figure out how to apply skill points.  Have no idea what my fighting patterns where/are.  All my friends lists have been delayed, so I have no clue who is on, and no I don't remember their names.

In a nutshell, I really don't give a dame about the free trial and I am glad I could waist it and be some statistic for them.  So it goes.
