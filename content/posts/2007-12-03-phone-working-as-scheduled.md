So, for now it's over.  The drama between Comcast and Vonage is closed.  It seems Comcast finally got their shit together and all the previous issues are gone.  What a pain in the ass, I am glad it may be past us.  The moral to this story is, if you need something done at Comcast, and they keep dropping the ball, get the FCC involved, they will contact senior offices and they will have to do something, I guess--Well it worked in this case anyway.
