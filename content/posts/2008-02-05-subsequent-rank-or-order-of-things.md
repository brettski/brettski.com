I would like to complete this list for eleven, and thirteen through nineteen if it's possible.  Have always been curious on all these names.  Used to discuss them with an old co-worker Paul.  My other thought is, are these even accurate and/or correct?  This list from [Wiktionary ](http://en.wiktionary.org)([tertiary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tertiary)).
