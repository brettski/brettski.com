My son is six and really likes music.  I really want him to enjoy music and listen to it when he can, but I am having a real problem figuring out what to let him listen too.  There is so much out there and so much of it just doesn't seem appropriate and I don't feel like answering 20 questions about each song.  There are alway kids songs but they often mechanically suck.  Disney channel?  music is ok, but I don't like the "perfect person" standard they are setting.

Perhaps I am just being to hypocritical and need to chill out.  I don't know, I just don't want to force feed my son into the "perfect" world of Disney TV.  It really is commercial shit.

Are there any suggestions out there that wont bore the hell out of my son or make me wonder how it's twisting him?
