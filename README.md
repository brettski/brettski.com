# Hi

A project to take an old website and an even older wordpress site and create something with them using Gatsby.

Ideas and guidence from:

- [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)
- [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)
  - [The End of an Era: Migrating from WordPress to Gatsby](https://www.taniarascia.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-gatsby/)
- [Var9k/Gatsby-Dvanced-Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/)
  - Though I didn't use this starter, I got some good ideas from it

I chose not to use the advanced started to provide the ability to build out the sections myself. I feel I am learning much more this way which is important as React innerds is quite new to me.
