## Who

Me, Brett

## What

Different attempts to replace the very aged asp.net mvc site which has served over the years.

Along with that tie in the wordpress blog hosted at wordpress.com. Not that its a bad service or expensive in how I am using it, it would be nice to have everything static and in one place.

## When

As time allows and where it can be snuck in

## Why

Who doesn't like to try new things?

## How

Name it

## Attempts

**Gatsby**: No too bad, the static nature of things and my horrible lack of understadning of react made it not turn out as I was hoping.

**Svelte**: Too new, can't comment yet...
